# Make a calculator that performs +, -, *, / between two numbers.

# 💡 TIP:
# Use `input()` for numbers and operator, then `if-elif` to select operation.
# Taking input from the user
num1 = float(input("Enter first number: "))
operator = input("Enter operator (+, -, *, /): ")
num2 = float(input("Enter second number: "))

# Performing calculation based on operator
if operator == "+":
    result = num1 + num2
elif operator == "-":
    result = num1 - num2
elif operator == "*":
    result = num1 * num2
elif operator == "/":
    if num2 != 0:
        result = num1 / num2
    else:
        result = "Error: Division by zero!"
else:
    result = "Invalid operator!"

# Printing the result
print("Result:", result)
