# Puzzle / Learning focus:
# - You have a sorted array with repeated elements.
# - Count how many times a target number appears using binary search logic.
# - Consider how to find the first and last occurrence efficiently.
#
# Example test cases:
# Input: arr = [1, 2, 2, 2, 3, 4], target = 2
# Output: 3
#
# Input: arr = [5, 5, 5, 5, 5], target = 5
# Output: 5
